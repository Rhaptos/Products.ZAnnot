Security Use Cases

  Zope's security mechanism is extremely flexible and allows for many
  ways to setup ZAnnot.  Here are some common setups that you might
  want to try.


  Totally Open Annotation Server

    - Anonymous users can view, post, and delete annotations

    The site manager should create the 'Annotation Server' object.
    Make sure the following permission settings are active on the
    annotation server object (either explicitly or through
    acquisition)::
    
      Access contents information : Anonymous
      View			  : Anonymous
      Aannot: Add Annotation	  : Anonymous
      ZAnnot: Delete Annotation	  : Anonymous
      ZAnnot: Edit Annotaton	  : Anonymous


  "Normal" Server (This the default setup for ZAnnot)

    - Anonymous users can view annotations

    - Authenticated users can post, edit and delete their own annotations

    - Site managers can delete any/all annotations

    The site manager should create the 'Annotation Server' object as
    well as user accounts for anyone allowed to post an annotation.
    Make sure the following permission settings are active on the
    annotation server object (either explicitly or through
    acquisition)::

      Access contents information : Anonymous
      View			  : Anonymous
      ZAnnot: Add Annotation	  : Authenticated
      ZAnnot: Delete Annotation	  : Owner, Manager
      ZAnnot: Edit Annotaton	  : Owner, Manager


  Private Server

    - Only Authenticated users can view annotations

    - Authenticated users can post, edit and delete their own annotations

    - Site managers can delete any/all annotations

    The site manager should create the 'Annotation Server' object as
    well as user accounts for anyone who will be able to view and post
    annotations.  Make sure the following permission settings are
    active on the annotation server object (either explicitly or
    through acquisition)::

      Access contents information : Authenticated (and *not* Anonymous)
      View			  : Anonymous
      ZAnnot: Add Annotation	  : Authenticated
      ZAnnot: Delete Annotation	  : Owner, Manager
      ZAnnot: Edit Annotaton	  : Owner, Manager


  Segmented Private Server

    - Authenticated users can view (only) their own annotations
  
    - Authenticated users can post, edit and delete their own annotations

    - Site managers can delete any annotations
